    description:
      "Problem: The organization's outdated HR management system caused delays in employee onboarding and lacked user access control, leading to inefficiencies and data security concerns. Action: I led the front-end development of a new HR management platform using React, Tailwind CSS, and PostgreSQL, with role-based access for Admin, HR Officers, and Users. Result: The new system reduced onboarding time by 40%, improved data security through user type restrictions, and increased HR team productivity.",
